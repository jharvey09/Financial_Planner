# Personal Financial Planner
This project was created in Python using two tools that are used for finaincial planning. Creating a Personal Finance Planner that allowed users to visualize their savings composed by investments split between shares and cryptocurrencies. 
Also createing a Retirement Planning Tool that will use the Alpaca API to grab historical closing prices for a projected retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, later running a few different Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. 
### Added Projections
I ran a couple of extra simulations on shorter terms to show different simulated returns using the Monte Carlo simulator. You can see terms for 5 and 10 year projections.

# Resources
1. Alpaca Markets API
2. Alternative Free Crypto API

# Steps
1. Collect Crypto Prices Using [requests] Library
2. Collect Investment Data Using Alpaca: SPY/ AGG Stocks
3. Saving Health Analysis
4. Run Monte Carlo Simulation
5. Retirement Analysis
