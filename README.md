# Financial Planner
This project was crated in PYTHON to show 2 tools used for finaincial planning. Creating a Personal Finance Planner that allowed users to visualize their savings composed by investments split between shares and cryptocurrencies. Also createing a Retirement Planning Tool that will use the Alpaca API to grab historical closing prices for a projected retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, later running a few different Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
